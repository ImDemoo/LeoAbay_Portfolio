I have always been captivaed into discovering and learning new abilities and things to keep me busy. As a result of this curiosity I am one to join many different hobbies and activities might it be active or passive. This lead me to gainign multiple hobbies that keeps my brain fresh and my body strong.


## The Physical Activities
I am one that likes to get up and going might it be excersing or playing sports or simply doing activities that require physicality. At my elementary days I have learnt and loved playing sports, may it be basketball and/or volleyball. My curiosity only grew on sports as I grew up where I learnt Soccer and Football. I may not have been the tallest or the most talented at sports in every sport I joined, I just enjoyed it as much as I could. This included being a basketball varsity during highschool and I still enjoy and play basketball to this day. This love and passion for physical activities made me come to the gym just for the thirst of doing physical activities, and I can say that I enjoy every second of every physical activity I do.
